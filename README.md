```javascript
{ !false }
// It's funny because it's true...

const fact = (later === never);

Fun facts

1. I cleaned up my [Github](https://github.com/fast-junkie) account... so many repos... so many purged... twice.
2. I've unwatched countless repos... ah... the tranquility.
3. I _NEVER_ link to [Github](https://github.com/fast-junkie) in my <abbr title="Curriculum Vitae">CV</abbr>... why...? If the `asker` dislikes the `seeker`, no amount of code is going to reverse that.
